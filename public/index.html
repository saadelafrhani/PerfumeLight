      The %PUBLIC_URL% placeholder in the tags above will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build process.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from this HTML file.
      Using "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" ensures that the favicon works correctly with both client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      For more information on configuring a non-root public URL, run `npm run build`.
